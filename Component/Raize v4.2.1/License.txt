ACTIVEX TECHNOLOGIES AND RAIZE COMPONENTS
Recent versions of Delphi and C++Builder offer extensive ActiveX support. Starting with Delphi 3, it is possible to convert a native Delphi component into an ActiveX control.  Converting any of the Raize Components into an ActiveX control and then redistributing the resulting control with or without the Raize Components runtime package is prohibited.  However, using the Raize Components within an ActiveForm is permissible.
